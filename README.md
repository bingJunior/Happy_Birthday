# Happy_Birthday

A simple Android Application as a present for your loved one's on there birthday

In this application on landing activity we have a countdown timer for the recepients birthday
Everthing else on UI is frozen until and unless his/her birthday arrives 
On that very day a button shows up in the app 
On clicking that very button the surprise is revealed
That surprise can be a video or a photo album stored in the app 

Birth date can be changed in the souce code by going to main_activity.java on line 55
Surprise video can be changed in the souce code by going to raw folder on the path "HappyBirthday\app\src\main\res\raw"
User should rename there video fike to "video.mp4" in order to avoid the inconvenience of syntactical error 
If you wish you could change the file name of the video in surprise.java on line 24
